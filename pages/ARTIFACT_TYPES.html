To give full credit, the following is based on the Eamon Deluxe documentation.
This important information has changed in Eamon CS 1.8.0 and is reprinted here
in hopes it will be useful.

4.4    ARTIFACT TYPES

There are 17 types of recognized artifacts. You are also allowed to enter a
value of 17, 18, or 19 for your own special types.  All USER types are treated
as type 1 by Eamon CS unless you add your own code. Creating new artifact
types is very uncommon as most any type you'll need is already pre-programmed
and it is strongly suggested that you stay within the usual types. The types
are as follows:

 Type                 Format    Type                  Format
 ---------------------------    ----------------------------
  0. Gold...............0       10. Readable.............5
  1. Treasure...........0       11. Door/Gate............6
  2. Weapon.............1       12. Edible...............4
  3. Magic Weapon.......1       13. Bound Monster........7 
  4. In Container.......2A      14. Wearable.............8
  5. On Container.......2B      15. Disguised Monster....9
  6. Under Container....2B      16. Dead body............10
  7. Behind Container...2B      17. Undefined, User......0
  8. Lightable..........3       18. Undefined, User......0
  9. Drinkable..........4       19. Undefined, User......0

All of the formats have the same information in the Artifact object, including
Value, Weight, Location, etc.  The Type and remaining format fields are stored
in one or more ArtifactCategory objects, referenced by the Artifact.  Format #0
is all USER fields, the rest of the format fields 1-5 contain the following.

  Format 1             Format 2A              Format 2B

     notice a mountain backpack [with "???" inside it].  This behavior only
     occurs for In Containers when they are open.
