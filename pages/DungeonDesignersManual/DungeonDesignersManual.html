        <h4>EFFECT RECORD CHAINING</h4>
        <p>
            It would be useful to describe how Effect record chaining works in Eamon CS. It is a mechanism borrowed from Eamon Deluxe and expanded to include strings both stored as Effects and dynamically calculated by C# methods (the
            latter available only in custom games). Effect record chaining in Eamon CS is very powerful and allows text output to be changed based on a game's current state. There are many examples of this scattered throughout the
            collection of completed games.
