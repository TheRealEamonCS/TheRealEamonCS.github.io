        <h4>1. PREFACE</h4>
        <p>
            For those who wish to start playing Eamon CS immediately, this Quick Start Guide summarizes the Players Manual, which dives deeper into the game's details. But it's still highly recommended you read through the Players Manual
            at least once. You will better understand the Eamon CS system and the history and mechanics of the world of Eamon in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            The QSG uses terminology with which you should be familiar. "Rooms" are discrete locations on the game map typically linked together using compass directions. "Artifacts" refer to inanimate objects in the game world recognized by
            the parser; they can be interacted with and manipulated. "Embedded Artifacts" are only evident upon careful examination of something else's description (typically a room or other artifact). "Monsters" refer to animate or living
            entities in the game world recognized by the parser; they can be interacted with, depending on their disposition. The game database stores all this information to drive the adventure.
        </p>
        <h4>2. INSTALLATION</h4>
        <p>
            Eamon CS has no formal installer, so setting up for play consists of either downloading an archive file and unzipping it into a folder or cloning the repository directly from GitHub.  However, there are prerequisites not included
            with the distribution that need to be present on your system for Eamon CS to be functional.  This subject is covered extensively in the <a href="../TechnicalPaper/TechnicalPaper.html#ECSTP2">PREREQUISITES</a> and
            <a href="../TechnicalPaper/TechnicalPaper.html#ECSTP3">POST-INSTALLATION TOPICS</a> sections of the Technical Paper found on the Eamon CS website.
        </p>
        <h4>3. PLAYING AN ADVENTURE</h4>
        <p>
            Eamon CS uses batch or script files stored under QuickLaunch to run programs, depending on your operating system. You'll find an EamonMH folder that contains the files needed to enter the Main Hall. When you enter, you will meet
            the Burly Irishman, who allows you to sign in as an existing character or create a new one. He will lead you through the character creation process if you enter a name not found in his registry. Alternately, you can join the men
            drinking beer, a mistake you'll likely make only once.
        </p>
        <p>
            A set of pre-made characters of varying power levels is available if you want to use them. Run the EditCharacters batch or script file under EamonDD and choose menu options two, four, and one to get a listing of their names.
        </p>
        <h4>4. CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES</h4>
        <p>
            Intellect measures how intelligent, wise, and perceptive a character is; it affects the odds of learning skills and spells. Hardiness determines the strength and vitality of a character - how much weight is carryable and how many
            damage points are sustainable before death occurs. Agility helps determine the odds of striking an enemy during combat, dodging attacks, and (in some adventures) avoiding reflex-based special events, such as traps. Finally,
            charisma reflects the character's physical appearance, poise, confidence, and persuasiveness; it affects merchant negotiations and influences monster reactions such that they may become allies or enemies.
        </p>
        <h4>5. CHARACTER ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            All Eamon characters have weapon abilities, spell abilities, and armor expertise - or, for beginners, lack thereof. A weapon or spell ability represents the odds of striking an opponent in battle with a given weapon type or
            successfully casting a specific type of spell, respectively. These values typically range from 1-100%, where a higher number means greater mastery. Worn armor negatively affects the odds of hitting, ranging from -65% to 0%; armor
            expertise gained can mitigate this penalty. Character stat bonuses or penalties can also cause ability values to fall outside the normal ranges.
        </p>
        <h4>6. WEAPONS AND ARMOR</h4>
        <p>
            You will become familiar with an adventurer's tools of the trade - weapons and armor.  There are five weapon categories, and all weapons in the game fall under one of these - Axe,  Bow, Club, Spear, and Sword.  Weapon artifacts have
            an Odds (or Complexity) that slightly impacts combat chances and indicates build quality or use difficulty; this can range from less than 0% (low quality) to +25% or more (masterfully crafted).  Armor types range from none (plain
            clothes) to full plate mail and beyond (magical armor); these protections absorb some or all damage inflicted, in most cases, but with a to-hit penalty in combat (see section 5).  Also, a shield can be used for further protection by
            those with one-handed weapons.
        </p>
        <h4>7. SPELLS</h4>
        <p>
            There are four standard magic spells available for use. The Blast spell directs a burst of mystical energy at an artifact or monster to damage or injure it, respectively; the Heal spell can remove injuries from any monster,
            including the caster. The Speed spell doubles the caster's Agility for a brief time, while the Power spell has unique and unpredictable results that can vary between adventures.
        </p>
        <h4>8. THE MAIN HALL AND ENVIRONS</h4>
        <p>
            The Main Hall is a central hub where Eamon characters meet, hang out, and go on adventures. Some shops offer needed supplies such as weapons, armor, and spells; a banker also provides his services. The nearby Village and Practice
            Area cater to a more upscale clientele with various specialized merchants. Together, these shops and diversions pass for Eamon's economy. There are many ways to spend (or, with bad luck, squander) that hard-earned gold!
        </p>
        <h4>9. THE CHARACTER EDITOR</h4>
        <p>
            You can modify every detail of a character to your liking by running the EditCharacters batch or script file under EamonDD and choosing menu option two. At this point, you will be on the Character Record Menu. From there, to list
            character names or details, select menu option four; note the unique ID (Uid) of the character you want to modify. Then you can use menu option two to edit or menu option three to delete.  Other utilities may prove valuable as well.
            For example, menu option five can give you a status summary of all characters, including where they are adventuring.  These details are otherwise obscured in Eamon CS Mobile by lack of access to the device's filesystem.
        <p>
        <h4>10. STARTING AN ADVENTURE</h4>
        <p>
            When in the Main Hall, choose menu option one to go on an adventure. Depending on which batch or script file you ran to enter the Main Hall, the adventure database is either a flat list of games or a hierarchy organized by category.
            It doesn't matter which; the result is the same when you make a selection. The adventure begins, and you are presented with the introduction story, if one exists. If you exit the game during the intro story or QUIT while playing,
            the character remains there until game completion, death occurs, or the character's state is manually changed. The local wizard accessed through the Burly Irishman's front desk can recall an adventuring character, as can the EamonDD
            program. You can also resume the adventure (if necessary) using the proper batch or script file under EamonRT and type QUIT HALL at the game's command prompt.
        </p>
        <h4>11. PLAYING AN ADVENTURE</h4>
        <p>
            When the EamonRT adventure program has started, it will display its revision number and a welcome message, then proceed into the "Main Loop." All commands and events return to this part of the program; the Main Loop displays
			information about the current room (and sometimes special details or events) and then prompts for a command. By typing "X" (or any unrecognized command), a list of all commands valid for the current adventure will display. Typing
			HINTS will give you general information about playing Eamon CS and specific help for this game. Note: Players new to Eamon CS should type HINTS and read the "General Help" section immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Main Loop of a standard Eamon adventure displays: the current room's name, a list of monsters and visible artifacts in the room, and finally, the command prompt. Also, some adventures may have extra details or special events
            during the Main Loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game displays a detailed text description when you initially see something in an Eamon adventure. These descriptions can be repeated anytime using the commands LOOK and EXAMINE.
        </p>
        <h4>12. NOTES ON SOME ADVENTURE COMMANDS</h4>
        <p>
            The most basic input recognized by the Eamon CS parser is of the form:  [COMMAND] [DIRECT OBJECT] [INDIRECT OBJECT].  The command is a verb, like GET.  Often, a direct object follows the command, such as GET YARN.  If prepositions
            (like in, on, to, from, with, etc.) follow the direct object, they are noted and removed.  Any remaining words are assumed to be an indirect object.  Example:  REMOVE PIE FROM OVEN would be parsed into REMOVE (command), PIE (direct
            object), and OVEN (indirect object).
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond this simple form, the Eamon CS parser accepts full sentence input, supporting many advanced features such as direct object lists, pronouns, and various containment types.  You are encouraged to explore this topic when it is
            convenient by reading the <a href="../TechnicalPaper/TechnicalPaper.html#ECSTP7">MISCELLANEOUS GAMEPLAY NOTES</a> section of the Technical Paper on the Eamon CS website.
        </p>
        <p>
            READY is used to equip a weapon for combat.  EamonRT will automatically ready the character's best weapon when the game starts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            WEAR is used to have your character equip armor or put on any other wearable artifact.  Note:  WEAR is also used to equip shields.
        </p>
        <p>
            INVENTORY displays a list of the character's (or a friendly monster's) possessions, general health, and gold carried.
        </p>
        <p>
            STATUS will display a "character sheet" with detailed information about your character and their present condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            REMOVE has two functions: remove an artifact worn by your character or remove an artifact contained by another artifact (the latter referred to as a "container artifact"). Note: Eamon CS has four container types, and their contents
            are accessed using the corresponding preposition. They are In Containers, On Containers, Under Containers, and Behind Containers.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use the wildcard direct object "ALL" with the GET and DROP commands. Note: While there is no REMOVE ALL command for container artifacts, you can often use the ATTACK command to break them; after their contents spill into
            the room, use the GET ALL command.
        </p>
        <p>
            SAVE will save an exact position in an adventure, and RESTORE will return to that position.  You can save up to five games in each adventure, with the option of giving each saved game a unique name.  Note:  Faster, more convenient
            "quick save" and "quick restore" options are also available; use the HINTS command and select option one ("General Help") for details on how to use those features.
        </p>
        <h4>13. LEAVING AN ADVENTURE</h4>
        <p>
            The QUIT command exits an adventure temporarily, leaving your character there; you can resume the game at a later time. The QUIT HALL command returns your character to the Main Hall in the same state as when the adventure started.
            All progress is lost, and saved games are deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Characters that die while adventuring return to the Main Hall as such (and can be revived with EamonDD). Those that survive are (usually) returned with armor worn and four weapons (of your choice); any excess loot carried out is
            also sold to a local merchant.
        </p>
        <h4>14. RECOMMENDED READING, FIRST ADVENTURES, ETC...</h4>
        <p>
            The Eamon CS Players Manual describes all standard Eamon CS commands in detail. Also, there is a lot of useful information in the "General Help" section that you can access in all Eamon CS adventures using the HINTS command.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is highly recommended that those new to Eamon CS use a medium to tough test character and play through the Eamon Deluxe 5.0 Demo Adventure first. This adventure guides new players through every general aspect of Eamon CS gaming,
            offering tips and examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            Afterward, a new "real" character should be created and taken through the Beginner's Cave (or the Beginner's Forest) for the authentic Eamon experience. These adventures (as well as several others) are accessible via the Main Hall
            using any EamonMH batch or script file.
