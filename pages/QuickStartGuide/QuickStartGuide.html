        <h4>1. PREFACE</h4>
        <p>[Note:&nbsp; this document is a work in progress]</p>
        <p>
            For those who wish to start playing Eamon CS immediately, this Quick Start Guide summarizes the Players Manual, which dives deeper into the game's details. But it's still highly recommended you read through the Players Manual at
            least once. You will gain a better understanding of the Eamon CS system and the history and mechanics of the world of Eamon in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            The QSG uses terminology with which you should be familiar. "Rooms" are discrete locations on the game map typically linked together using compass directions. "Artifacts" refer to inanimate objects in the game world recognized
            by the parser; they can be interacted with and manipulated. "Embedded Artifacts" are only evident upon careful examination of something else's description (typically a room or other artifact). "Monsters" refer to animate or
            living entities in the game world recognized by the parser; they can be interacted with. The game database stores all this information and uses it to drive the adventure.
        </p>

        <h4>3. PLAYING AN ADVENTURE</h4>
        <p>
            Eamon CS uses batch or script files stored under QuickLaunch to run programs, depending on your operating system. There is an EamonMH folder that contains the files used to enter the Main Hall. When you enter, you will meet the
            Burly Irishman, who gives you the option to sign in as an existing character or create a new one. If you enter a name not found in his registry, he will lead you through the character creation process. Alternately, you can join
            the men drinking beer, a mistake you'll likely make only once.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a set of pre-made characters of varying power levels available if you want to use them. Run the EditCharacters batch or script file under EamonDD and choose menu options two, then four, then one to get a listing of
            their names.
        </p>
        <h4>4. CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES</h4>
        <p>
            Intellect measures how intelligent, wise, and perceptive a character is; it affects the odds of learning skills and spells. Hardiness determines the strength and vitality of a character - how much weight is carryable and how
            many damage points are sustainable before death occurs. Agility helps determine the odds of striking an enemy during combat, dodging attacks, and (in some adventures) avoiding reflex-based special events, such as traps. Charisma
            reflects the character's physical appearance, poise, confidence, and persuasiveness; it affects merchant negotiations and influences monster reactions such that they may turn into allies or enemies.
        </p>
        <h4>5. CHARACTER ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            All Eamon characters have weapon abilities, spell abilities, and armor expertise - or, for beginners, lack thereof.  A weapon ability represents the odds of striking an opponent in battle, normally ranging from 1-100%.  A spell
            ability represents the odds of successfully casting the spell, again normally ranging from 1-100%.  Higher values mean greater mastery.  Worn armor negatively affects odds to hit, ranging from -65% to 0%; armor expertise gained
            can mitigate this penalty.  Additionally, character stat bonuses or penalties can cause ability values to fall outside the normal ranges.
        </p>
        <h4>6. WEAPONS AND ARMOR</h4>
        <p>
            You will become familiar with an adventurer's tools of the trade - weapons and armor.  There are five weapon categories, and all weapons in the game fall under one of these - Axe,  Bow, Club, Spear, Sword.  Weapon artifacts have
            an Odds (or Complexity) that slightly impacts combat chances and indicates build quality or use difficulty; this can range from less than 0% (low quality) to +25% or more (masterfully crafted).  Armor types range from none (plain
            clothes) to full plate mail and beyond (magical armor); these protections absorb some or all damage inflicted, in most cases, but with a to-hit penalty in combat (see section 5).  Also, a shield can be used for further protection by
            those with one-handed weapons.
        </p>
        <h4>7. SPELLS</h4>
        <p>
            There are four standard magic spells available for use. The Blast spell directs a burst of mystical energy at an artifact or monster to damage or injure it, respectively; the Heal spell can remove injuries from any monster,
            including the caster. The Speed spell doubles the caster's Agility for a brief time, while the Power spell has unique and unpredictable results that can vary between adventures.
        </p>
        <h4>8. THE MAIN HALL AND ENVIRONS</h4>
        <p>
            The Main Hall is a central hub where Eamon characters meet, hang out, and go on adventures. There are shops available that offer needed supplies such as weapons, armor, and spells; a banker also provides his services. The Village
            and Practice Area located nearby cater to a more upscale clientele, with various specialized merchants. Together, these shops and diversions are what pass for an economy in Eamon.  There are many ways to spend (or, with bad luck,
            squander) that hard-earned gold!
        </p>
        <h4>9. THE CHARACTER EDITOR</h4>
        <p>
            You can modify every detail of a character to your liking by running the EditCharacters batch or script file under EamonDD and choosing menu option two. You will be on the Character Record Menu. From there, to list character names
            or details, select menu option four; note the unique ID (Uid) of the character you want to modify. Then you can use menu option two to edit or menu option three to delete.  Other utilities may prove useful as well.  For example,
            menu option five can give you a status summary of all characters, including where they are adventuring.  These details are obscured in Eamon CS Mobile by lack of access to the device's filesystem.
        <p>
        <h4>10. STARTING AN ADVENTURE</h4>
        <p>
            When in the Main Hall, choose menu option one to go on an adventure. Depending on which batch or script file you ran to enter the Main Hall, the adventure database is either a flat list of games or a hierarchy organized by
            category. It doesn't matter which; when you make a selection, the result is the same. The adventure begins, and you are presented with the introduction story if one exists. If you exit the game during the intro story or QUIT
            while playing, the character remains there until game completion, or death occurs, or the character's state is manually changed. The local wizard accessed through the Burly Irishman's front desk can recall an adventuring character,
            as can the EamonDD program. You can also resume the adventure (if necessary) using the proper batch or script file under EamonRT and type QUIT HALL at the game's command prompt.
