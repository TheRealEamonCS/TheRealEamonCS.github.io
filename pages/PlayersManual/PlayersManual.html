        <h4>1. PREFACE</h4>
        <p>[Note:&nbsp; this document is a work in progress]</p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is a computerized roleplaying game, or "RPG" for short.  When you play one of these games, you assume control of a character in an interactive story filled with adventure and danger.  Your alter ego is a member of the Free
            Adventurer's Guild in the world of Eamon.  This guild contains like-minded individuals who choose to live by their wits, seeking glorious treasures and defeating horrible monsters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many RPG gaming systems, Eamon CS takes a freeform approach to character advancement.  There are no direct goals to achieve, no experience points to earn, and no way to finish or "win the game."  The main focus instead is the
            improvement of various character attributes and the amassing of wealth.  The pursuit of personal goals (help the less fortunate, defeat all evil beings, etc.) may also be incorporated into each adventure if desired.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM1_1"></a>
        <h4>1.1 A BRIEF HISTORY OF EAMON</h4>
        <p>
            The Eamon roleplaying game dates back to the dawn of the personal computer era.  It has gone through extended periods of activity over the decades but also languished, written off as a relic. However, the system tends to emerge and
            reinvent itself as new technologies develop.  For this reason, it is also one of the most enduring computerized gaming systems ever created.
        </p>
        <p>
            Research published on the internet indicates Donald Brown created Eamon in the late 1970s; by the early 1980s, it had been standardized and released to the public domain.  The game successfully fuses two genres popular at the time -
            "text adventures" and "roleplaying games" - with features that appeal to both players and adventure designers.  Brown built the vanilla game engine, some documentation and utilities, and a set of example games to study.  He then
            departed from Eamon, never to return.  A growing collection of authors who delighted to take the game engine and pack it with a host of special behaviors contributed to the adventure catalog throughout the 1980s.  The endless
            flexibility of Eamon remains a contributor to its longevity.
        </p>
        <p>
            After Brown's departure from the scene, control of Eamon passed to John Nelson.  Nelson polished and enhanced the base source code, created an extended set of adventures, and started the National Eamon Users Club (NEUC).  NEUC
            organized the Eamon catalog by standardizing game numbers and produced semi-regular newsletters.  During the early years, NEUC was instrumental in coordinating all things Eamon.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the 1990s arrived, Nelson was committed to porting Eamon to the IBM PC; that left less time to manage the Apple II codebase and NEUC.  Into this vacuum stepped Thomas Zuchowski, who assumed control of both.  Zuchowski, a
            member of NEUC, was an accomplished adventure designer and newsletter writer; he renamed the Club the Eamon Adventurer's Guild.  The group became a professional base for Eamon fans, with a regular newsletter published quarterly
            for 15 years!  Zuchowski continued the work of fixing bugs and polishing the existing vanilla codebase.  But he also upgraded it with many customized formulas to address perceived weaknesses in the system, overhauled the game
            database structure to make it leaner and more efficient, and rewrote the manuals to match.  The "modern" Eamons of today trace their lineage back to work done by Zuchowski during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 2001, interest in Eamon had waned to the point where few new adventures were being written, and the Apple II codebase was no longer under active development. As a result, Tom Zuchowski formally decided to shut down the Eamon
            Adventurer's Guild and stepped away from his role as caretaker for Eamon.  But before doing so, he passed control to a man named Matthew Clark.  Clark had already spent several years building and maintaining the official Eamon
            Adventurer's Guild website, located at <a target="_blank" href="https://eamonag.org">www.eamonag.org</a>, and also authored a high-quality Eamon adventure of his own.  At the time of this writing, the website is
            functional but appears to be under care and maintenance.
        </p>
            During its lifespan, The Wonderful World of Eamon was the basis for various porting efforts and at least a dozen side projects, some of which were far more sophisticated than the original system.  In addition to Donald Brown's
            commercialized derivative SwordThrust, the game can count among its progeny Eamon II, KnightQuest, Super Eamon, Imagery! and a host of others.  Information about these systems is available on the EAG website; however, the last of
            the BASIC games, Eamon Deluxe, stands out and requires a full accounting.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe began in late 1997 as a project based on an advanced Apple II Eamon codebase and was first released on MS-DOS in mid-1998.  Initially, versions 1 and 2 were intended as a learning tool for the
            author; the focus was on creating NEW Eamon adventures and taking full advantage of a more advanced hardware and programming environment.  In 1999 version 3 was released, featuring automated adventure conversion and a system for
            multi-adventure sets.  The goal for version 4.2, released in 2001, became the conversion of all existing Apple II Eamon games. This painstaking process continued to 2006 but was then abandoned due to lack of interest and real-world
            demands.  In late 2012, a rekindled interest in Eamon led to version 5.0, with software completely rewritten for efficiency while adding many new and enhanced features.  This version of Eamon is the foundation (albeit distant) of
            all modern non-BASIC Eamons, including Eamon CS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eamon AC (EAC) is the earliest prototype of Eamon CS; it was written incrementally between mid-2014 and mid-2015 in ANSI C. The project's goal was to answer the author's long-standing question: what would Eamon look like in the C
            family of languages? This port involved a meticulous reproduction of Eamon Deluxe's MAINPGM.BAS file. While EAC was complete and fully functional, only The Beginner's Cave was ported before work halted. Unfortunately, the resulting
            monolithic EamonRT game engine lacked the elegance and extensibility expected from a modernized Eamon. A new approach was needed. As a result, the unmaintained Eamon AC is obsolete and should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
            The C# programming language seemed like the next logical step for development. Work on Eamon CS (ECS) kicked off in mid-2015, and it formally debuted in early 2017. By building ECS on this platform, it can potentially avoid the fate
            of many older Eamons. The system rides in the .NET slipstream indefinitely into the future, never needing an emulator to run. Also, as Microsoft's flagship development environment, the .NET ecosystem is vast and continues to expand;
            Eamon CS Mobile is an example of using compatible 3rd party technology.  The game engine takes a toolkit approach to development, encouraging code reuse through inheritance.  Many enhancements have been made to Eamon CS over the years,
            including multi-category artifacts, a plugin-based architecture, an advanced container framework, a full-sentence parser, and utilities to convert data from previous Eamon systems. The game catalog has grown to include 13 classic and
            original adventures, with more on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is worth noting this game system is not the only activity in Eamon these days; two other projects should be mentioned. The first is Keith Dechant's Eamon Remastered, found at <a target="_blank" href="https://eamon-remastered.com">www.eamon-remastered.com</a>.
            This is an Eamon variant that runs in the web browser with an extensive collection of ported games. The second is Huw Williams' Eamon Wiki, located at <a target="_blank" href="https://eamon.wiki">www.eamon.wiki</a>. This website
            explores all topics related to Eamon, including author correspondence, game walkthroughs, maps, and trivia. Please be sure to check out both of these excellent resources when you have the chance!

        <h4>2. PLANET EAMON</h4>
        <p>
            Far away, at the dead center of the Milky Way, is the planet Eamon. It doesn't orbit any suns; two great suns orbit it! The shifting pull from these great bodies brings strange forces to bear upon this planet, twisting light, tides, even
            the laws of science itself! Strange things happen on Planet Eamon, and the citizens must always be adaptable, for things are rarely what they seem and quite often not the same as they were from one day to the next!
        </p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is played through characters who are imagined to be citizens of this weird world that belong to the famous Free Adventurer's Guild. Free Adventurers are men and women who have dared to seek their fortune in the marvelous world of
            shifting laws and time. Players will often find their characters fighting terrible monsters such as orcs, trolls, and dragons and claiming various riches and treasures as their own. However, Planet Eamon is bound by no laws of time or
            space, and anything can happen once an adventure has been started. At any random time, a character could end up facing such varied opponents as Billy the Kid or Darth Vader!
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM3"></a>
        <h4>3. BASIC CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES AND ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is a mixture of two popular types of gaming systems, namely "adventure games" and "fantasy role-playing games." In an adventure game, a player normally explores pre-mapped settings, often locating special objects or solving various
            puzzles to proceed to other parts of the game until reaching the ending.
        </p>
        <p>
            Role-playing games (or "RPGs") also involve diverse pre-mapped settings. But rather than playing a single adventure in the first-person perspective, RPGs are based heavily upon creating and developing characters that the player then uses as
            alter-egos.  A character is taken on many adventures, the player assuming this character as they explore and make decisions. Characters can quickly develop through shrewd adventuring, growing stronger in various attributes and skill levels
            while gaining wealth and acquiring better equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            All new characters created in Eamon CS start at a beginning level.  Like the people playing them, they are a diverse group with different strengths and weaknesses. Four numbers (or "attributes") will describe a newly created character's general
            mental and physical makeup. These are called Intellect, Hardiness, Agility, and Charisma. These attributes are each obtained by the computer rolling three eight-sided dice and adding the results together. Thus the numbers can range from three
            (the lowest) to twenty-four (the highest), with most rolls averaging twelve to fifteen.
        </p>
        <p>
            This technique is called "rolling three-die-eight" (commonly written as "3D8"), and the terminology comes from various multi-sided dice used in the original pencil and paper style role-playing games upon which computer RPG games are based. These
            strange-looking dice are used to determine random factors, adding a stronger sense of reality to the gaming experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with the four main attributes, characters are also defined by various skills, including weapon abilities, spell casting, and combat experience involving fighting while wearing heavy, protective armor. While a character's skills will increase
            with use, the four basic attributes cannot be changed through "natural" means in any way. However, Eamon is a magical world, and you may find ways to increase (and sometimes decrease) a character's attributes in certain adventures.  Also, when a
            character becomes wealthy enough, there are special shops in the village and practice areas just outside of the Main Hall, which rumor has it, can boost any attribute or ability (see <a href="#ECSPM7">section 7</a> for more information).
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who wish to instantly create a character with specific attributes, ability levels, etc. (and who don't mind a little "cheating"), Eamon CS includes an editing program that allows every aspect of a character to be customized to exact
            specifications (see <a href="#ECSPM8_1">section 8.1</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sake of example, in the next few sections, it is assumed that a new character named "Hedric the Horrible" has just been "created" with an Intellect of seventeen, a Hardiness of thirteen, an Agility of twenty, and a Charisma of five.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM3_1"></a>
        <h4>3.1 INTELLECT</h4>
        <p>TODO</p>
        <a name="ECSPM3_2"></a>
        <h4>3.2 HARDINESS</h4>
        <p>
            A character's Hardiness has two major effects.  First, it represents the number of damage points that their body can withstand before they die.  Second, it is used to calculate the total amount of weight in weapons, armor, and other objects
            that they can carry with them. The standard unit of weight in Eamon CS is called "gronds." Gronds are sometimes further split into tenths using a smaller unit called "DOS" (so one grond equals ten DOS).  There is no real reason for using Grond
            or DOS units other than that is what Donald Brown decided when he created the original Eamon system. Eamon CS (being based on Eamon Deluxe) preserves this system and further standardizes it as one grond generally weighs as much as two gold
            coins.  However, cumbersome items (like a stack of plates or a full quiver of arrows) can weigh more in gronds than they would if only using the two-coin system.
        </p>

            Hedric the Horrible, whom we just "created," has a Hardiness of thirteen. So he can withstand thirteen harmful "hits" (damage caused by attacks from an enemy, being poisoned, setting off traps, etc.) before he perishes. Hedric can also carry
            up to ten times his Hardiness in items, or one hundred thirty gronds. The amount of weight carryable is a static number derived from base Hardiness, not the number of hits taken; a character can carry the same amount whether critically wounded
            or in perfect health.

        <h4>3.3 AGILITY</h4>
        <p>
            In Eamon CS, the only major effect of a character's Agility is found in combat. A character with high Agility is more likely to strike an opponent and dodge attacks from that opponent. Some adventures will also use the character Hardiness
            or Agility to resolve other situations specific to that setting (like the chances of successfully opening special objects or avoiding dangerous traps).

        <h4>4.1 WEAPON TYPES AND CHARACTER WEAPON ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            All new characters start with the same skill levels for weapon expertise: 5% for axes, -10% for projectile weapons, 20% for clubs, 10% for spears, and 0% for swords. These numbers reflect that an inexperienced adventurer who is just beginning
            is more likely to hit an enemy with a club than an arrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weapon abilities can increase through the successful use of each type of weapon in combat. If Hedric the Horrible is fighting a troll and scores a successful hit, then a dice roll will be used to determine if Hedric learned anything about how
            to use his weapon better.  His chance to learn is the same as his chance to have missed, so a one hundred-sided "percentage" die (or 1D100) is rolled.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if Hedric's chance to hit is 40%, he will have a 60% chance of his weapon ability going up by 2%. In the next round, his chance of hitting the same opponent would then be increased to 42%, while his chance of raising his ability
            would reduce to 58%. Weapon abilities continue to increase until reaching the natural limit of 100%.

        <h4>4.3 BASIC COMBAT: ATTACKING AN OPPONENT</h4>
        <p>
            Every time a character attempts to strike another living being, there is a percentage chance of success, which is calculated by comparing multiple factors. Likewise, opponents have a similar set of factors determining their chance of success
            when attempting to harm your character.
        </p>
        <p>
            All combatants have a base chance of 50% plus two times the difference in Agility and armor between them and their target. If a weapon is being used, half of the "weapon odds" value is added (up to a maximum increase of 15%). If your character
            is the attacker, their Armor Class, Armor Expertise, and relevant weapon ability are also figured into their odds to hit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the odds to hit are determined, if a roll of 1D100 ranges from one to the percentage chance to hit, the blow is considered a success, and the resulting damage is calculated. In addition, there may also be magical or other extraordinary effects
            in some adventures, which will factor into combat as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the roll is greater than the chance to hit, the attacker will miss their opponent or fumble the attack. The negative impact of a fumble on the attacker ranges from benign to disastrous, including, among other things, a recovery, a dropped, damaged,
            or broken weapon, or a self-inflicted injury.

        <h4>5. MAGIC SPELLS AND RELATED CHARACTER ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            The strange shifting forces around Planet Eamon constantly create effects that can only be described as magical. However, most of these effects are highly localized to a particular adventure setting and will not be consistent from one foray to
            the next.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are four common spells that work almost everywhere. Any character can pay a knowledgeable wizard to teach these spells at a starting level. When a spell is first learned, a 1D100 die is rolled, and the starting ability is set, ranging from
            25% to 75%. As with combat abilities, there is a chance that each spell ability can be increased every time your character successfully casts that spell.  If a 1D100 die roll exceeds the chance to cast it, the spell ability will increase by 2%
            until the natural limit of 100% is reached.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, Hedric has now learned the BLAST spell with a starting ability of 30%. If he successfully casts the spell and a 1D100 roll yields a result exceeding 30%, then his overall ability for that spell will increase to 32%, with a roll
            exceeding 32% being required for the next increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also "wildcard" rolls involved in spell casting: a roll from one to five will always be successful, while a roll of one hundred will overload your character's mind.  In this case, the spell cannot be cast for the rest of the
            adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The channeling of supernatural powers through the body can be tiring. Every time your character successfully casts a spell, the next chance is reduced by half until the brain fatigue clears by "resting up" for a bit. Use the STATUS command to
            see the current and overall spell ability values, among other helpful information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this is the way the four common spells usually work. However, Eamon CS is a marvelous and very random world. Spell abilities may not drop at all when your character uses them in some adventures, while in other places, spells may
            work quite differently or sometimes not at all.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_1"></a>
        <h4>5.1 THE BLAST SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            Your character can use this spell to send a magical blast of pure energy at either an opponent or an item (such as locked doors or chests). If successfully cast, a BLAST spell will always hit its target and do 1D6 in damage. Also, if the
            target is a living being, armor will not help absorb any damage from a BLAST spell.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_2"></a>
        <h4>5.2 THE HEAL SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            This spell can remove damage points from the character casting it or any other living creature (in effect, "healing" them). If successfully cast, a HEAL spell will remove 1D10 in damage points from its target.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_3"></a>
        <h4>5.3 THE SPEED SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            If successfully cast, a SPEED spell will double your character's Agility for a random amount of time (ranging from eleven to twenty turns). Suppose a SPEED spell is cast successfully while another one is already in effect. In that case, the
            new spell will increase the number of rounds left but will not further multiply a character's Agility. The SPEED spell is useful when a character is engaged in combat with a skilled opponent, has to avoid a deadly trap, or needs to write a
            lengthy paper within a short amount of time.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_4"></a>
        <h4>5.4 THE POWER SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            Depending on your character's adventure, successfully casting a POWER spell may cause a harmless diversion or have powerful effects (both helpful and harmful). It's essentially a call to the magical forces around your character that says,
            "Hey, do something!" In many adventures, Power will do little more than make a loud noise; in others, it may be the key to survival or accessing different parts of the game. So if you become stuck (or feel daring), give POWER a try.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM6"></a>
        <h4>6. RELATING WITH CITIZENS, MONSTERS, AND OTHER LIVING BEINGS</h4>
        <p>
            There are two places your character will be encountering other denizens of Planet Eamon, out on adventures and at the Main Hall of the Guild of Free Adventurers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Guild heavily protects the Main Hall and its surrounding areas. While your characters may communicate with the various people there to do business, they will not be permitted to start fights or break any other rules. The Guild also enforces
            fair business policies on the various merchants; while they will not do any real favors for your characters (except possibly giving them better prices depending upon their Charisma), they will not cheat their customers or otherwise harm them.
            They are mostly simple businessmen and women, out to relieve Free Adventurers of their gold while helping outfit them to go get more.
        </p>
        <p>
            During your adventures outside of the Main Hall, however, anything can happen. By default, any being found in an adventure may seem rather simple-minded; when they first meet your character, they will decide if they like them, dislike them, or
            choose to ignore them completely. If they are friendly, they will follow your character and fight on their side during any battles. If they are hostile, they will most likely try to fight them in deadly combat. Once they make up their minds, they
            will usually keep with their decisions, unless your character does something particularly nasty (such as ATTACK a friend) or nice (such as GIVE a "neutral" monster extremely valuable items or large sums of money).
        </p>
        <p>
            Just because monsters do or do not like your character does not always mean that they will fight to the bitter end either; some will be less courageous (or smarter) than others and will run from what they view as a losing battle. In some adventures,
            they will run out of exits and into a nearby room to which you can follow them. In others, they may leave the game altogether, never to return.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Eamon adventures are unique, however. Some will allow your character to interact further with its inhabitants, including options to make small talk, ask important questions, have conversations, give orders, get ideas, play games, etc...

        <h4>7.1 BUYING WEAPONS AND ARMOR</h4>
        <p>
            Marcos Cavelli owns a small weaponry outlet in the Main Hall, specializing in standard weapons and armor at fair prices. New characters begin with 200 gold pieces to spend on equipment. That should get them leather armor and at least one decent
            weapon if they can strike a bargain when visiting Marcos' shop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marcos carries the five standard weapons: an axe, which does 1D6 of damage and has a base price of 25 gold pieces, a 1D6 bow for 40 gp, a 1D4 mace for 25 gp, and a 1D8 sword which has a base price of 30 gp. Marcos will also buy used weapons; he
            pays 15 gold pieces for an average or poor-quality weapon and considerably more for high-quality or magical weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marcos' base prices for armor are 50 gold pieces for a shield, 100 gp for leather, 250 gp for chain mail, and 500 gp for plate armor. He also gives you trade-in credit for your old armor (but at somewhat less than what you paid for it).
        </p>
        <p>
            Like all of the businesses in the Main Hall, Marcos' credit terms are straightforward: none.

        <p>
            Hokas Tokas, the resident wizard of the Main Hall, is willing to teach anybody spells for a price. His base prices for spells are 100 gold pieces to learn POWER, 1000 gp for HEAL, 3000 gp for BLAST, and 5000 gp for SPEED. Hokas is gruff but
            fair; he will never cheat you and will stick by you until you learn your spell.

            loans (he makes enough money from adventurers who deposit money with him and never return.)

            slightly more information. Exiting the universe will safely store your character until you are ready to return to the Wonderful World of Eamon CS for further adventuring.

        <p>
            Upon returning to the Main Hall from an adventure, you will be stopped and inspected by the Knight Marshal on duty.  He enforces the laws of the Guild, among them a limit on the number of carryable weapons.  If your weapon count exceeds
            four, you are allowed to select the ones to sell along with the rest of your loot; the remainder you may keep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the Knight Marshal allows you to pass through the first gate, you must proceed to the local buyer of treasure and booty.  Typically, this will be Sam Slicker, a shrewd and experienced (but fair) businessman who has been in the
            pawnbroker business for quite some time.
        </p>
        <p>
            A character's Charisma can affect haggling ability and the resale value of items.  A high Charisma score can add an extra five to ten percent to the offer on most items; a low score can deduct from the bid.  Some things (such as precious
            metals) will always be worth the same amount, no matter what.  By the time you're done with Sam, you will carry only weapons and armor; everything else is converted to gold for safekeeping.

            challenging to do so, given the level of polish in the EDX Player's Manual.  So I'll give credit to the excellent writing of Frank Black, Luke Hewitt, and TMF.
