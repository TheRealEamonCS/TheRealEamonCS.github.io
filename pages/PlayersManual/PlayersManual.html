            Eamon CS is a computerized roleplaying game, or "RPG" for short.  When you play one of these games, you assume control of a character in an interactive story filled with adventure and danger.  Your alter ego is a member of the Free
            Adventurer's Guild in the world of Eamon.  This guild contains like-minded individuals who choose to live by their wits, seeking glorious treasures and defeating terrible monsters.
        </p>

            Unlike many RPG gaming systems, Eamon CS takes a freeform approach to character advancement.  There are no direct goals to achieve, no experience points to earn, and no way to finish or "win the game."  The main focus instead is the
            improvement of various character attributes and the amassing of wealth.  The pursuit of personal goals (help the less fortunate, defeat all evil beings, etc.) may also be incorporated into each adventure if desired.

            The Eamon CS Player's Manual is based on both Donald Brown's original Eamon text and especially Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe, which sets the gold standard.  While I do try to rework the text to make it unique, it is often
            difficult to do so given the level of polish in the EDX Player's Manual.  So I'll give credit to the excellent writing of Frank Black, Luke Hewitt, and TMF.</p>
