        <h4>1. PREFACE</h4>
        <p>[Note:&nbsp; this document is a work in progress]</p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is a computerized roleplaying game, or "RPG" for short.  When you play one of these games, you assume control of a character in an interactive story filled with adventure and danger.  Your alter ego is a member of the Free
            Adventurer's Guild in the world of Eamon.  This guild contains like-minded individuals who choose to live by their wits, seeking glorious treasures and defeating horrible monsters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many RPG gaming systems, Eamon CS takes a freeform approach to character advancement.  There are no direct goals to achieve, no experience points to earn, and no way to finish or "win the game."  The main focus instead is the
            improvement of various character attributes and the amassing of wealth.  The pursuit of personal goals (help the less fortunate, defeat all evil beings, etc.) may also be incorporated into each adventure if desired.

        <h4>2. PLANET EAMON</h4>
        <p>
            Far away, at the dead center of the Milky Way, is the planet Eamon. It doesn't orbit any suns; two great suns orbit it! The shifting pull from these great bodies brings strange forces to bear upon this planet, twisting light, tides, even
            the laws of science itself! Strange things happen on Planet Eamon, and the citizens must always be adaptable, for things are rarely what they seem and quite often not the same as they were from one day to the next!
        </p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is played through characters who are imagined to be citizens of this weird world that belong to the famous Free Adventurer's Guild. Free Adventurers are men and women who have dared to seek their fortune in the marvelous world of
            shifting laws and time. Players will often find their characters fighting terrible monsters such as orcs, trolls, and dragons and claiming various riches and treasures as their own. However, Planet Eamon is bound by no laws of time or
            space, and anything can happen once an adventure has been started. At any random time, a character could end up facing such varied opponents as Billy the Kid or Darth Vader!

            The Eamon CS Player's Manual is based on both Donald Brown's original Eamon text and especially Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe, which sets the gold standard.  While I do try to rework the text to make it unique, it can be
            challenging to do so, given the level of polish in the EDX Player's Manual.  So I'll give credit to the excellent writing of Frank Black, Luke Hewitt, and TMF.
