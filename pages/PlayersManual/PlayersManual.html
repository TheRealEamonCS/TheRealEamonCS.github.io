        <h4>1. PREFACE</h4>
        <p>[Note:&nbsp; this document is a work in progress]</p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is a computerized roleplaying game, or "RPG" for short.  When you play one of these games, you assume control of a character in an interactive story filled with adventure and danger.  Your alter-ego is a member of the Free
            Adventurer's Guild in the world of Eamon.  This guild contains like-minded individuals who choose to live by their wits, seeking glorious treasures and defeating horrible monsters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many RPG gaming systems, Eamon CS takes a freeform approach to character advancement.  There are no direct goals to achieve, no experience points to earn, and no way to finish or "win the game."  The main focus instead is the
            improvement of various character attributes and the amassing of wealth.  The pursuit of personal goals (help the less fortunate, defeat all evil beings, etc.) may also be incorporated into each adventure if desired.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM1_1"></a>
        <h4>1.1 A BRIEF HISTORY OF EAMON</h4>
        <p>
            The Eamon roleplaying game dates back to the dawn of the personal computer era.  It has gone through extended periods of activity over the decades but also languished, written off as a relic. However, the system tends to emerge and
            reinvent itself as new technologies develop.  For this reason, it is also one of the most enduring computerized gaming systems ever created.
        </p>
        <p>
            Research published on the internet indicates Donald Brown created Eamon in the late 1970s; by the early 1980s, it had been standardized and released to the public domain.  The game successfully fuses two genres popular at the time -
            "text adventures" and "roleplaying games" - with features that appeal to both players and adventure designers.  Brown built the vanilla game engine, some documentation and utilities, and a set of example games to study.  He then
            departed from Eamon, never to return.  A growing collection of authors who delighted to take the game engine and pack it with a host of special behaviors contributed to the adventure catalog throughout the 1980s.  The endless
            flexibility of Eamon remains a contributor to its longevity.
        </p>
        <p>
            After Brown's departure from the scene, control of Eamon passed to John Nelson.  Nelson polished and enhanced the base source code, created an extended set of adventures, and started the National Eamon Users Club (NEUC).  NEUC
            organized the Eamon catalog by standardizing game numbers and produced semi-regular newsletters.  During the early years, NEUC was instrumental in coordinating all things Eamon.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the 1990s arrived, Nelson was committed to porting Eamon to the IBM PC; that left less time to manage the Apple II codebase and NEUC.  Into this vacuum stepped Thomas Zuchowski, who assumed control of both.  Zuchowski, a
            member of NEUC, was an accomplished adventure designer and newsletter writer; he renamed the Club the Eamon Adventurer's Guild.  The group became a professional base for Eamon fans, with a regular newsletter published quarterly
            for 15 years!  Zuchowski continued the work of fixing bugs and polishing the existing vanilla codebase.  But he also upgraded it with many customized formulas to address perceived weaknesses in the system, overhauled the game
            database structure to make it leaner and more efficient, and rewrote the manuals to match.  The "modern" Eamons of today trace their lineage back to work done by Zuchowski during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 2001, interest in Eamon had waned to the point where few new adventures were being written, and the Apple II codebase was no longer under active development. As a result, Tom Zuchowski formally decided to shut down the Eamon
            Adventurer's Guild and stepped away from his role as caretaker for Eamon.  But before doing so, he passed control to a man named Matthew Clark.  Clark had already spent several years building and maintaining the official Eamon
            Adventurer's Guild website, located at <a target="_blank" href="https://eamonag.org">www.eamonag.org</a>, and also authored a high-quality Eamon adventure of his own.  At the time of this writing, the website is
            functional but appears to be under care and maintenance.
        </p>
            During its lifespan, The Wonderful World of Eamon was the basis for various porting efforts and at least a dozen side projects, some of which were far more sophisticated than the original system.  In addition to Donald Brown's
            commercialized derivative SwordThrust, the game can count among its progeny Eamon II, KnightQuest, Super Eamon, Imagery! and a host of others.  Information about these systems is available on the EAG website; however, the last of
            the BASIC games, Eamon Deluxe, stands out and requires a full accounting.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe began in late 1997 as a project based on an advanced Apple II Eamon codebase and was first released on MS-DOS in mid-1998.  Initially, versions 1 and 2 were intended as a learning tool for the
            author; the focus was on creating NEW Eamon adventures and taking full advantage of a more advanced hardware and programming environment.  In 1999 version 3 was released, featuring automated adventure conversion and a system for
            multi-adventure sets.  The goal for version 4.2, released in 2001, became the conversion of all existing Apple II Eamon games. This painstaking process continued to 2006 but was then abandoned due to lack of interest and real-world
            demands.  In late 2012, a rekindled interest in Eamon led to version 5.0, with software completely rewritten for efficiency while adding many new and enhanced features.  This version of Eamon is the foundation (albeit distant) of
            all modern non-BASIC Eamons, including Eamon CS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eamon AC (EAC) is the earliest prototype of Eamon CS; it was written incrementally between mid-2014 and mid-2015 in ANSI C. The project's goal was to answer the author's long-standing question: what would Eamon look like in the C
            family of languages? This port involved a meticulous reproduction of Eamon Deluxe's MAINPGM.BAS file. While EAC was complete and fully functional, only The Beginner's Cave was ported before work halted. Unfortunately, the resulting
            monolithic EamonRT game engine lacked the elegance and extensibility expected from a modernized Eamon. A new approach was needed. As a result, the unmaintained Eamon AC is obsolete and should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
            The C# programming language seemed like the next logical step for development. Work on Eamon CS (ECS) kicked off in mid-2015, and it formally debuted in early 2017. By building ECS on this platform, it can potentially avoid the fate
            of many older Eamons. The system sits in the .NET slipstream, never needing an emulator to run. Also, as Microsoft's flagship development environment, the .NET ecosystem is vast and continues to expand; Eamon CS Mobile is an example
            of using compatible 3rd party technology. The game engine takes a toolkit approach to development, encouraging code reuse through inheritance. Many enhancements have been made to Eamon CS over the years, including multi-category
            artifacts, a plugin-based architecture, an advanced container framework, a full-sentence parser, and utilities to convert data from previous Eamon systems. The game catalog has grown to include 13 classic and original adventures, with
            more on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is worth noting this game system is not the only activity in Eamon these days; two other projects should be mentioned. The first is Keith Dechant's Eamon Remastered, found at <a target="_blank" href="https://eamon-remastered.com">www.eamon-remastered.com</a>.
            This is an Eamon variant that runs in the web browser with an extensive collection of ported games. The second is Huw Williams' Eamon Wiki, located at <a target="_blank" href="https://eamon.wiki">www.eamon.wiki</a>. This website
            explores all topics related to Eamon, including author correspondence, game walkthroughs, maps, and trivia. Please be sure to check out both of these excellent resources when you have the chance!

        <h4>2. PLANET EAMON</h4>
        <p>
            Far away, at the dead center of the Milky Way, is the planet Eamon. It doesn't orbit any suns; two great suns orbit it! The shifting pull from these great bodies brings strange forces to bear upon this planet, twisting light, tides, even
            the laws of science itself! Strange things happen on Planet Eamon, and the citizens must always be adaptable, for things are rarely what they seem and quite often not the same as they were from one day to the next!
        </p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is played through characters who are imagined to be citizens of this weird world that belong to the famous Free Adventurer's Guild. Free Adventurers are men and women who have dared to seek their fortune in the marvelous world of
            shifting laws and time. Players will often find their characters fighting terrible monsters such as orcs, trolls, and dragons and claiming various riches and treasures as their own. However, Planet Eamon is bound by no laws of time or
            space, and anything can happen once an adventure has been started. At any random time, a character could end up facing such varied opponents as Billy the Kid or Darth Vader!
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM3"></a>
        <h4>3. BASIC CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES AND ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is a mixture of two popular types of gaming systems, namely "adventure games" and "fantasy role-playing games." In an adventure game, a player normally explores pre-mapped settings, often locating special objects or solving various
            puzzles to proceed to other parts of the game until reaching the ending.
        </p>
        <p>
            Role-playing games (or "RPGs") also involve diverse pre-mapped settings. But rather than playing a single adventure in the first-person perspective, RPGs are based heavily upon creating and developing characters that the player then uses as
            alter-egos.  A character is taken on many adventures, the player assuming this character as they explore and make decisions. Characters can quickly develop through shrewd adventuring, growing stronger in various attributes and skill levels
            while gaining wealth and acquiring better equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            All new characters created in Eamon CS start at a beginning level.  Like the people playing them, they are a diverse group with different strengths and weaknesses. Four numbers (or "attributes") will describe a newly created character's general
            mental and physical makeup. These are called Intellect, Hardiness, Agility, and Charisma. These attributes are each obtained by the computer rolling three eight-sided dice and adding the results together. Thus the numbers can range from three
            (the lowest) to twenty-four (the highest), with most rolls averaging twelve to fifteen.
        </p>
        <p>
            This technique is called "rolling three-die-eight" (commonly written as "3D8"), and the terminology comes from various multi-sided dice used in the original pencil and paper style role-playing games upon which computer RPG games are based. These
            strange-looking dice are used to determine random factors, adding a stronger sense of reality to the gaming experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with the four main attributes, characters are also defined by various skills, including weapon abilities, spell casting, and combat experience involving fighting while wearing heavy, protective armor. While a character's skills will increase
            with use, the four basic attributes cannot be changed through "natural" means in any way. However, Eamon is a magical world, and you may find ways to increase (and sometimes decrease) a character's attributes in certain adventures.  Also, when a
            character becomes wealthy enough, there are special shops in the village and practice areas just outside of the Main Hall, which rumor has it, can boost any attribute or ability (see <a href="#ECSPM7">section 7</a> for more information).
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who wish to instantly create a character with specific attributes, ability levels, etc. (and who don't mind a little "cheating"), Eamon CS includes an editing program that allows every aspect of a character to be customized to exact
            specifications (see <a href="#ECSPM8_1">section 8.1</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sake of example, in the next few sections, it is assumed that a new character named "Hedric the Horrible" has just been "created" with an Intellect of seventeen, a Hardiness of thirteen, an Agility of twenty, and a Charisma of five.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM3_1"></a>
        <h4>3.1 INTELLECT</h4>
        <p>TODO</p>
        <a name="ECSPM3_2"></a>
        <h4>3.2 HARDINESS</h4>
        <p>
            A character's Hardiness has two major effects.  First, it represents the number of damage points that their body can withstand before they die.  Second, it is used to calculate the total amount of weight in weapons, armor, and other objects
            that they can carry with them. The standard unit of weight in Eamon CS is called "gronds." Gronds are sometimes further split into tenths using a smaller unit called "DOS" (so one grond equals ten DOS).  There is no real reason for using Grond
            or DOS units other than that is what Donald Brown decided when he created the original Eamon system. Eamon CS (being based on Eamon Deluxe) preserves this system and further standardizes it as one grond generally weighs as much as two gold
            coins.  However, cumbersome items (like a stack of plates or a full quiver of arrows) can weigh more in gronds than they would if only using the two-coin system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hedric the Horrible, whom we just "created," has a Hardiness of thirteen. So he can withstand thirteen harmful "hits" (damage caused by attacks from an enemy, being poisoned, setting off traps, etc.) before he perishes. Hedric can also carry
            up to ten times his Hardiness in items, or one hundred thirty gronds. The amount of weight carryable is a static number derived from base Hardiness, not the number of hits taken; a character can carry the same amount whether critically wounded
            or in perfect health.

        <h4>3.3 AGILITY</h4>
        <p>
            In Eamon CS, the only major effect of a character's Agility is found in combat. A character with high Agility is more likely to strike an opponent and dodge attacks from that opponent. Some adventures will also use the character Hardiness
            or Agility to resolve other situations specific to that setting (like the chances of successfully opening special objects or avoiding dangerous traps).
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM3_4"></a>
        <h4>3.4 CHARISMA</h4>
        <p>
            A character's Charisma is a combination of both their physical attractiveness and how likable their personality is. Charisma can often affect how the citizens and other sentient beings on Planet Eamon will react to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, many merchants will offer slightly better pricing deals to a likable character with a high Charisma than an average or low Charisma. While on an adventure, a character's Charisma may also affect how some creatures react to them,
            choosing to attack, ignore, or become friends with them. The more friends a character has in an adventure, the more help they have during battles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The actual percentage adjustment that Charisma has upon the decisions of others (or "Charisma Factor") is figured out by subtracting ten from the character's Charisma and multiplying the difference by two.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the smelly hermit from the Beginner's Cave has a base friendliness of 50%. With a charisma of ten, Joe Normal will make friends with the hermit 50% of the time. However, Hedric the Horrible (with his Charisma of five) has only a 40%
            chance of making friends with the hermit. Lovable Linda, with a maximum charisma of twenty-four, has a 78% chance of making friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Joe Normal: (10 - 10 = 0, 0 x 2 = 0). 50% + 0% = 50%.<br>
            Hedric the Horrible: (5 - 10 = -5, -5 x 2 = -10). 50% + -10% = 40%.<br>
            Lovable Linda: (24 - 10 = 14, 14 x 2 = 28). 50% + 28% = 78%.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, many of the beings encountered on adventures will have a pre-set friendliness factor and thus react the same regardless of your character's Charisma. A rat with a friendliness rating of 0% will never be a friend, be it with Joe Normal,
            Hedric the Horrible, or Lovable Linda; likewise, a fellow adventurer with a friendliness rating of 100% will always befriend your character.
        </p>

        <h4>4. COMBAT RELATED CHARACTER ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            Combat is often an important aspect of Eamon, being a rough and violent world. In most adventures, combat is taken care of on a blow-by-blow basis. Typically, every valid combatant in the room gets one turn to attack one enemy; the effects of that
            attack are calculated, and the result (hit or miss) is applied. However, you will find that certain powerful creatures can launch multiple attacks in one combat turn, sometimes against different enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            All weapons are simplified into types zero through five. Type zero is "natural weapons," which can include just about anything but will always have the same odds (0% bonus) and can never be dropped or broken. Weapon types one through five are
            axes (any "chopping" weapons), projectile weapons (everything from a standard archery set to a machine gun), clubs (any blunt weapons), spears (all weapons used with lunging or jabbing motions), and swords.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weapon types one through five have what is referred to as "weapon odds" or sometimes "weapon complexity." This number reflects the quality of the weapon and how hard it is to use properly. For example, a club may have an odds value of twenty since
            it is easy to use, while a more complicated weapon such as a bow may have a negative odds value (-10 is common for bows). The actual effect of weapon odds on a combatant's chances to hit their opponent is described in further detail in
            <a href="#ECSPM4_3">section 4.3</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The amount of physical damage a weapon will inflict is determined by the damage "dice" of that weapon. All weapons (including "natural") have a pre-set number of dice with a pre-set number of sides. For example, an average sword has a damage level
            set around 1D10 or 2D5, meaning one ten-sided dice that causes 1-10 points of damage or two five-sided dice that cause 2-10 points of damage, respectively. Thus, a normal "powerful" weapon will have a damage level of around 2D8 (capable of doing 2-16
            points of damage).
        </p>
        <p>
            Standard levels of armor are also divided into types. Even numbers determine the actual type of armor, with odd numbers indicating that a shield is also included. For example, chain armor alone has a value (or "class") of four, chain armor with a
            shield is class five, and so on. Armor class names are used generically, regardless of what the armor is actually comprised of (a dragon with class four armor made of scales would still be considered "chain armor").
        </p>
        <p>
            In most cases, armor is factored in as "hits absorbed" from an attack, meaning the wearer has a certain amount of damage deducted from the total applied when struck in combat. The basic "armor class" and the hits deducted by each are as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
      Armor Class   Name  Hits Absorbed
     -----------------------------------
      0 ............None .........0
      1 ............Shield .......1
      2 ............Leather ......1
      4 ............Chain ........2
      6 ............Plate ........5
      8 ............Magic ........6
        </pre>
        </p> 
        <p>
            Armor also affects the odds of opponents striking each other in combat (after all, one isn't as agile when fighting inside a tin can!). Characters have abilities that often start in a lower range but increase to highly skilled levels given time and
            experience. Non-character combatants are also affected by weapon quality and armor encumbrance factors, but it is assumed they are skilled on an average level. The actual effect of worn armor on a combatant's chances to hit their opponent is
            described in further detail in <a href="#ECSPM4_3">section 4.3</a>.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM4_1"></a>
        <h4>4.1 WEAPON TYPES AND CHARACTER WEAPON ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            All new characters start with the same skill levels for weapon expertise: 5% for axes, -10% for projectile weapons, 20% for clubs, 10% for spears, and 0% for swords. These numbers reflect that an inexperienced adventurer who is just beginning
            is more likely to hit an enemy with a club than an arrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weapon abilities can increase through the successful use of each type of weapon in combat. If Hedric the Horrible is fighting a troll and scores a successful hit, then a dice roll will be used to determine if Hedric learned anything about how
            to use his weapon better.  His chance to learn is the same as his chance to have missed, so a one hundred-sided "percentage" die (or 1D100) is rolled.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if Hedric's chance to hit is 40%, he will have a 60% chance of his weapon ability going up by 2%. In the next round, his chance of hitting the same opponent would then be increased to 42%, while his chance of raising his ability
            would reduce to 58%. Weapon abilities continue to increase until reaching the natural limit of 100%.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM4_2"></a>
        <h4>4.2 ARMOR TYPES AND CHARACTER ARMOR EXPERTISE</h4>
        <p>
            Characters can use shields and several types of armor to help protect themselves from bodily harm. However, as mentioned above, the stronger the armor, the more cumbersome it is, and this will affect your character's chance to hit an opponent in
            combat until they fully develop a skill called "Armor Expertise."
        </p>
        <p>
            The following chart describes the types of armor, the amount of protection they provide, and how much they reduce a character's chance to hit an opponent. As with the similar chart above for non-character armor class, even numbers are types of
            armor, and odd numbers mean that a shield is also included.
        </p>
        <p>
        <pre>
Armor Class    Name     Hits Absorbed     Odds Adjustment
-----------------------------------------------------------
    0 .........None ...........0 .................0%
    1 .........Shield .........1 ................-5%
    2 .........Leather ........1 ................-10%
    4 .........Chain ..........2 ................-20%
    6 .........Plate ..........5 ................-60%
    8 .........Magic ..........6 ................-60%
        </pre>
        </p> 
        <p>
            The odds adjustment here reflects a new character with an Armor Expertise of zero. As the character becomes used to the constricting effects of fighting and maneuvering while wearing armor, their increased Armor Expertise will reduce the odds
            adjustment until, finally, the armor has no adverse effects at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            A character's Armor Expertise ability is developed the same way as their weapon abilities. Every time they successfully strike an opponent in combat, 1D65 is rolled; if the result is larger than the odds adjustment of their armor versus their
            current Armor Expertise, their ability increases by 2%. Armor Expertise will continue to increase until it reaches the maximum limit of 65%, after which any type of armor can be worn without negative effects.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM4_3"></a>
        <h4>4.3 BASIC COMBAT: ATTACKING AN OPPONENT</h4>
        <p>
            Every time a character attempts to strike another living being, there is a percentage chance of success, which is calculated by comparing multiple factors. Likewise, opponents have a similar set of factors determining their chance of success
            when attempting to harm your character.
        </p>
        <p>
            All combatants have a base chance of 50% plus two times the difference in Agility and armor between them and their target. If a weapon is being used, half of the "weapon odds" value is added (up to a maximum increase of 15%). If your character
            is the attacker, their Armor Class, Armor Expertise, and relevant weapon ability are also figured into their odds to hit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the odds to hit are determined, if a roll of 1D100 ranges from one to the percentage chance to hit, the blow is considered a success, and the resulting damage is calculated. In addition, there may also be magical or other extraordinary effects
            in some adventures, which will factor into combat as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the roll is greater than the chance to hit, the attacker will miss their opponent or fumble the attack. The negative impact of a fumble on the attacker ranges from benign to disastrous, including, among other things, a recovery, a dropped, damaged,
            or broken weapon, or a self-inflicted injury.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM4_4"></a>
        <h4>4.4 DAMAGE FACTORS</h4>
        <p>
            As explained in <a href="#ECSPM4_1">section 4.1</a>, a random amount of damage is done to the target when a blow hits. This amount of damage is based on the weapon's dice and dice sides; the armor worn by the defender usually lowers the base damage.
            Leather armor and shield each take one point of damage, chain armor takes 2, and plate armor takes 5 points of damage away from that taken on the body (all effects are cumulative and magical devices may sometimes act as armor).
        </p>
        <p>
            That, of course, is what usually happens. However, due to flashes of good luck or clumsiness, weird things can happen. For example, in many of the classic adventures, an attacker will get what is called a "Critical Hit" about 5% of the time. That will
            result in the following, each with its probability of occurrence: ignore armor (50%), three-halves normal damage (35%), twice normal damage (10%), triple normal damage (4%), or an automatic kill (1%). This was standard in the early versions of the
            original Eamon system and carried over to certain Eamon CS conversions to make them more authentic. For instance, The Temple of Ngurct has standard "classic" combat, and the Eamon Deluxe Demo Adventure has standard "modern" combat.
        </p>
        <p>
            About 4% of the time, the attacker will fumble a weapon. As a result, it will have one of the following effects: fumble recovery (35%), drop weapon (40%, for natural weapons such as claws, the attacker recovers instead), break weapon (20%, with a 10%
            chance of self-inflicted injury), normal self-inflicted injury (4%), and double-damage self-inflicted injury, ignoring armor (1%).
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5"></a>
        <h4>5. MAGIC SPELLS AND RELATED CHARACTER ABILITIES</h4>
        <p>
            The strange shifting forces around Planet Eamon constantly create effects that can only be described as magical. However, most of these effects are highly localized to a particular adventure setting and will not be consistent from one foray to
            the next.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are four common spells that work almost everywhere. Any character can pay a knowledgeable wizard to teach these spells at a starting level. When a spell is first learned, a 1D100 die is rolled, and the starting ability is set, ranging from
            25% to 75%. As with combat abilities, there is a chance that each spell ability can be increased every time your character successfully casts that spell.  If a 1D100 die roll exceeds the chance to cast it, the spell ability will increase by 2%
            until the natural limit of 100% is reached.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, Hedric has now learned the BLAST spell with a starting ability of 30%. If he successfully casts the spell and a 1D100 roll yields a result exceeding 30%, then his overall ability for that spell will increase to 32%, with a roll
            exceeding 32% being required for the next increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also "wildcard" rolls involved in spell casting: a roll from one to five will always be successful, while a roll of one hundred will overload your character's mind.  In this case, the spell cannot be cast for the rest of the
            adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The channeling of supernatural powers through the body can be tiring. Every time your character successfully casts a spell, the next chance is reduced by half until the brain fatigue clears by "resting up" for a bit. Use the STATUS command to
            see the current and overall spell ability values, among other helpful information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this is the way the four common spells usually work. However, Eamon CS is a marvelous and very random world. Spell abilities may not drop at all when your character uses them in some adventures, while in other places, spells may
            work quite differently or sometimes not at all.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_1"></a>
        <h4>5.1 THE BLAST SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            Your character can use this spell to send a magical blast of pure energy at either an opponent or an item (such as locked doors or chests). If successfully cast, a BLAST spell will always hit its target and do 1D6 in damage. Also, if the
            target is a living being, armor will not help absorb any damage from a BLAST spell.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_2"></a>
        <h4>5.2 THE HEAL SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            This spell can remove damage points from the character casting it or any other living creature (in effect, "healing" them). If successfully cast, a HEAL spell will remove 1D10 in damage points from its target.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_3"></a>
        <h4>5.3 THE SPEED SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            If successfully cast, a SPEED spell will double your character's Agility for a random amount of time (ranging from eleven to twenty turns). Suppose a SPEED spell is cast successfully while another one is already in effect. In that case, the
            new spell will increase the number of rounds left but will not further multiply a character's Agility. The SPEED spell is useful when a character is engaged in combat with a skilled opponent, has to avoid a deadly trap, or needs to write a
            lengthy paper within a short amount of time.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM5_4"></a>
        <h4>5.4 THE POWER SPELL</h4>
        <p>
            Depending on your character's adventure, successfully casting a POWER spell may cause a harmless diversion or have powerful effects (both helpful and harmful). It's essentially a call to the magical forces around your character that says,
            "Hey, do something!" In many adventures, Power will do little more than make a loud noise; in others, it may be the key to survival or accessing different parts of the game. So if you become stuck (or feel daring), give POWER a try.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM6"></a>
        <h4>6. RELATING WITH CITIZENS, MONSTERS, AND OTHER LIVING BEINGS</h4>
        <p>
            There are two places your character will be encountering other denizens of Planet Eamon, out on adventures and at the Main Hall of the Guild of Free Adventurers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Guild heavily protects the Main Hall and its surrounding areas. While your characters may communicate with the various people there to do business, they will not be permitted to start fights or break any other rules. The Guild also enforces
            fair business policies on the various merchants; while they will not do any real favors for your characters (except possibly giving them better prices depending upon their Charisma), they will not cheat their customers or otherwise harm them.
            They are mostly simple businessmen and women, out to relieve Free Adventurers of their gold while helping outfit them to go get more.
        </p>
        <p>
            During your adventures outside of the Main Hall, however, anything can happen. By default, any being found in an adventure may seem rather simple-minded; when they first meet your character, they will decide if they like them, dislike them, or
            choose to ignore them completely. If they are friendly, they will follow your character and fight on their side during any battles. If they are hostile, they will most likely try to fight them in deadly combat. Once they make up their minds, they
            will usually keep with their decisions, unless your character does something particularly nasty (such as ATTACK a friend) or nice (such as GIVE a "neutral" monster extremely valuable items or large sums of money).
        </p>
        <p>
            Just because monsters do or do not like your character does not always mean that they will fight to the bitter end either; some will be less courageous (or smarter) than others and will run from what they view as a losing battle. In some adventures,
            they will run out of exits and into a nearby room to which you can follow them. In others, they may leave the game altogether, never to return.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Eamon adventures are unique, however. Some will allow your character to interact further with its inhabitants, including options to make small talk, ask important questions, have conversations, give orders, get ideas, play games, etc...
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7"></a>
        <h4>7. THE MAIN HALL, THE VILLAGE AND THE PRACTICE YARD</h4>
        <p>
            Your new headquarters will be a room you rent at the Main Hall of the Guild of Free Adventurers. You can buy weapons, armor, and even spells there, as well as advance your skills through training, gamble, and get lost in other friendly diversions. In
            addition, you can check out your character's current attributes, skill levels, and possessions. You can also keep some money with the banker - cash in the bank is safe if you're robbed on an adventure but, then again, you can't use it to ransom
            yourself out of a sticky situation either!
        </p>
        <p>
            Those familiar with Classic Eamon will notice that Eamon CS features an extended Main Hall, three times the size of the original, which has two added areas of interest for your character to visit if you so desire.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems that the traditional open enrollment policy, combined with the lure of easily obtained wealth and fame, has turned the Guild of Free Adventurers into a major enterprise on planet Eamon over the years.  Many of the courageous and not a few of
            the foolhardy are attracted to seek fame and fortune by the sword. This large influx of adventurers has also lead to what business leaders call a subsidiary industry. A small village has been constructed just outside the gates of the Main Hall, its
            residents eagerly waiting to provide additional services to those who make a living as professional heroes. However, unlike those who run their businesses from within the Main Hall's gates, none of these village merchants carry the Official Guild
            Seal of Approval. Any business interactions with them are considered done at your character's own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the center of the village is a mysterious statue, thought to have been set up by some of Planet Eamon's very few benevolent priests.  It stands in memory of all those adventurers who have lost their lives while out on adventures. Some sort of
            spirit is rumored to live within the statue, and those who respectfully approach it may receive a reward (though whether this is true or just a rumor is quite uncertain). The odds are that, even if such a spirit did exist, it would likely be
            limited in its power, so anyone seeking it should probably not get greedy with hopes of repeated showers of such blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
            South of the village is the "practice yard." It is detached and slightly away from the other businesses so that the sound of clanging weapons and magic sonic blasts won't interfere too much with the more peaceful activities of its neighbors. In
            this practice yard can be found teachers, skilled in the various adventuring arts, who are ready to help you increase your skills-- for a large fee, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of the practice yard lies the info booth. Nobody is exactly sure what the shady character who runs it does, other than directing the more obtuse adventurers to the different trainers available. It is rumored that he also has
            information about hidden valuables that he may offer to share. But always for a price.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7_1"></a>
        <h4>7.1 BUYING WEAPONS AND ARMOR</h4>
        <p>
            Marcos Cavelli owns a small weaponry outlet in the Main Hall, specializing in standard weapons and armor at fair prices. New characters begin with 200 gold pieces to spend on equipment. That should get them leather armor and at least one decent
            weapon if they can strike a bargain when visiting Marcos' shop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marcos carries the five standard weapons: an axe, which does 1D6 of damage and has a base price of 25 gold pieces, a 1D6 bow for 40 gp, a 1D4 mace for 25 gp, and a 1D8 sword which has a base price of 30 gp. Marcos will also buy used weapons; he
            pays 15 gold pieces for an average or poor-quality weapon and considerably more for high-quality or magical weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marcos' base prices for armor are 50 gold pieces for a shield, 100 gp for leather, 250 gp for chain mail, and 500 gp for plate armor. He also gives you trade-in credit for your old armor (but at somewhat less than what you paid for it).
        </p>
        <p>
            Like all of the businesses in the Main Hall, Marcos' credit terms are straightforward: none.
        </p>

        <h4>7.2 BUYING SPELLS</h4>
        <p>
            Hokas Tokas, the resident wizard of the Main Hall, is willing to teach anybody spells for a price. His base prices for spells are 100 gold pieces to learn POWER, 1000 gp for HEAL, 3000 gp for BLAST, and 5000 gp for SPEED. Hokas is gruff but
            fair; he will never cheat you and will stick by you until you learn your spell.
        </p>

        <h4>7.3 THE BANKER</h4>
        <p>
            Shylock McFenney, the local banker, will open up an account for any Free Adventurer's Guild member. He is absolutely trustworthy with the funds left in his care and does not charge any fees. He also does not pay interest, nor does he make
            loans (he makes enough money from adventurers who deposit money with him and never return.)
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7_4"></a>
        <h4>7.4 SCHMITTY'S CASINO</h4>
        <p>
            Ernst Stavro Jesse James Schmitt runs the "Paris Casino," which is always open, always lively, and always offering free drinks accompanied with an invitation for Free Adventurers to risk their gold pieces. As a result, many a fortune has been
            built and lost, in the blink of an eye, after being bet against the spin of one of Schmitty's brightly colored roulette wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though many an unlucky gambler has bitterly accused Schmitty of rigging the wheels, in truth, the odds they give aren't too bad, and plenty of adventurers leave the tables with heavier pockets than when they entered. Schmitty doesn't seem to
            notice the rumors some patrons spread about his integrity. He chuckles and maintains his pleasant, outspoken demeanor, knowing that it means business is good (and that those spreading the rumors will most likely be back for more).
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7_5"></a>
        <h4>7.5 THE GOOD WITCH'S EMPORIUM</h4>
        <p>
            A beautiful and mysterious lady, nobody is exactly sure where the witch came from, though she has seen a brisk trade among the Guild's Adventurers since she arrived. Likewise, what goes into her magic potions is a mystery, though the
            ingredients are most likely rare and expensive, judging by her prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her draughts can raise your character's various attributes by one point and can even increase some of them over their maximum natural levels. However, each drink will cost several thousand gold pieces (with, perhaps, a slight discount for
            characters with above-average Charisma).
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7_6"></a>
        <h4>7.6 GRENDEL'S EXOTIC WEAPONS AND CUSTOM SMITHERY</h4>
        <p>
            When Marcos' weapons are found to no longer be adequate for the seasoned adventurer, those lucky adventurers who have survived long enough to become "seasoned" start looking outside the Guild walls for exotic, more powerful weaponry. Upon
            arriving at the village, Grendel the smith was quick to fill that gap. He now offers a highly reputable yet somehow still discrete service, providing an assortment of high-quality and individually tailored implements of destruction for the
            wealthy aggregator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grendel's inventory contains used weapons of all types, typically ranging from 2D8 damage for 500 gold pieces to 2D16 damage for 1200 gold pieces. Alternatively, suppose your character has acquired enough money. In that case, they can pay
            Grendel to design a custom weapon built to their specifications (choosing its name, its complexity, and its total damage potential). Weapons may be built with a deadliness factor of up to 3D12, although such weapons do not come cheap and may
            in fact require a small fortune be paid to Grendel before he begins work.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7_7"></a>
        <h4>7.7 SPELL PRACTICE (WITH A LICENSED WIZARD)</h4>
        <p>
            It is well known around the Main Hall that there is certainly no love lost between this extremely polite mystic and resident mage, Hokas Tokas. Indeed Hokas' drunken ravings about "that smarmy git" have become something of an occasional, highly
            amusing entertainment at the Main Hall bar. It can't be denied, though, that the mystic's focusing and concentration techniques have lead many average adventurers to some truly staggering heights of magical prowess.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a modest fee of 1000 gold pieces, the mystic will give your character a chance to practice one of their spells. The potential exists to raise that spell level by several points, even allowing it to increase beyond the natural limit of
            100% (though, the truly unlucky will risk a chance of paying the fee only to learn nothing at all).
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7_8"></a>
        <h4>7.8 WEAPON WIELDING 101 WITH DON DIEGO</h4>
        <p>
            Some have said the sum of Don Diego's abilities with every type of weapon is surpassed only by the size of his ego. However, the quality of his teaching can't be denied, and for 1000 gold pieces per strike, he'll offer your character the chance to
            improve their weapon abilities by attacking one of his practice dummies. All sales are final, and there is no guarantee: your character may get lucky and raise a skill by several points or possibly learn nothing at all. Like the practice yard's
            mystic, Don Diego can also help your character increase their weapon skills well above their natural limits.
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM7_9"></a>
        <h4>7.9 MASTERING THE ART OF WEARING ONE'S CLOTHES PROPERLY</h4>
        <p>
            Usually, adventurers only get smacked by a giant's club when trying to relieve said giant of their money and treasures. However, the giant who resides in the practice yard realized that, by aiding adventurers in the skill of efficiently fighting
            while burdened under the weight of heavy armor, he could keep his treasures.  He also gets paid hefty fees and still has the satisfaction of smacking adventurers silly with his club.
        </p>
        <p>
            For 1000 gold pieces per strike, the giant will take a swing at your character. Should they successfully dodge his attack, they will have a decent chance of increasing their Armor Expertise by several points. Though, if the giant manages to clobber
            them, they won't learn anything (and may even suffer some temporary memory loss instead).
        </p>
        <a name="ECSPM8"></a>
        <h4>8. EXAMINING YOUR CHARACTER AND LEAVING THE UNIVERSE</h4>
        <p>
            It does not cost you anything to examine your character or quit Eamon CS, unlike most activities in the Main Hall. The first option will create a "character sheet" style display, similar to using the STATUS command when on an adventure but with
            slightly more information. Exiting the universe will safely store your character until you are ready to return to the Wonderful World of Eamon CS for further adventuring.

        <h4>9.1 RETURNING FROM AN ADVENTURE (SELLING YOUR LOOT)</h4>
        <p>
            Upon returning to the Main Hall from an adventure, you will be stopped and inspected by the Knight Marshal on duty.  He enforces the laws of the Guild, among them a limit on the number of carryable weapons.  If your weapon count exceeds
            four, you are allowed to select the ones to sell along with the rest of your loot; the remainder you may keep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the Knight Marshal allows you to pass through the first gate, you must proceed to the local buyer of treasure and booty.  Typically, this will be Sam Slicker, a shrewd and experienced (but fair) businessman who has been in the
            pawnbroker business for quite some time.
        </p>
        <p>
            A character's Charisma can affect haggling ability and the resale value of items.  A high Charisma score can add an extra five to ten percent to the offer on most items; a low score can deduct from the bid.  Some things (such as precious
            metals) will always be worth the same amount, no matter what.  By the time you're done with Sam, you will carry only weapons and armor; everything else is converted to gold for safekeeping.

        <h4>9.2 STANDARD COMMANDS IN AN EAMON CS ADVENTURE</h4>
        <p>
            The following commands are standard in nearly every Eamon CS adventure. To see the current command list for an adventure, enter a question mark at the command prompt. To repeat your last command, hit Enter without typing anything (this is
            useful during combat, among other things). The HINTS command will bring up the help menu, which includes general tips for playing Eamon CS and any notes, tips, solutions, etc., specific to the current adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            MOVEMENT COMMANDS: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, FLEE, and GO.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try and move your character in the given direction if possible. In some adventures, you may also be able to move diagonally or indeterminately using the commands: NE, NW, SE, SW, IN, and OUT.
        </p>
        <p>
            If combat gets too rough, you can attempt to run away with the FLEE command. However, if you don't specify which way to go (FLEE SOUTH, FLEE DOWN, etc.), then the game will send your character scrambling in a randomly chosen direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use the GO command (or, when appropriate, FLEE) to enter both directional and free-standing portals.  These can take any imaginable form, including doors/gates, stairways, paths, crevices, structures, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            ITEM MANIPULATION COMMANDS:
        </p>
        <p>
            CLOSE: Attempt to close a door or container.
        </p>
        <p>
            DRINK and EAT: Attempt to consume something.
        </p>
        <p>
            DROP: Drop a carried item.
            DROP ALL: Attempt to drop every item your character is carrying.
        </p>

        <h4>10. CREDITS AND LICENSE INFO</h4>
        <p>
            The Eamon CS Player's Manual is based on Donald Brown's original Eamon text and especially Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe, which sets the gold standard for such documentation. While I try to rework the text to make it unique, it can be
            challenging, given the level of polish in the EDX Player's Manual. So I'll give credit to the excellent and imaginative writing of Frank Black, Luke Hewitt, and TMF.
