        <h4>1. PREFACE</h4>
        <p>[Note:&nbsp; this document is a work in progress]</p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is a computerized roleplaying game, or "RPG" for short.  When you play one of these games, you assume control of a character in an interactive story filled with adventure and danger.  Your alter ego is a member of the Free
            Adventurer's Guild in the world of Eamon.  This guild contains like-minded individuals who choose to live by their wits, seeking glorious treasures and defeating horrible monsters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many RPG gaming systems, Eamon CS takes a freeform approach to character advancement.  There are no direct goals to achieve, no experience points to earn, and no way to finish or "win the game."  The main focus instead is the
            improvement of various character attributes and the amassing of wealth.  The pursuit of personal goals (help the less fortunate, defeat all evil beings, etc.) may also be incorporated into each adventure if desired.

        <h4>2. PLANET EAMON</h4>
        <p>
            Far away, at the dead center of the Milky Way, is the planet Eamon. It doesn't orbit any suns; two great suns orbit it! The shifting pull from these great bodies brings strange forces to bear upon this planet, twisting light, tides, even
            the laws of science itself! Strange things happen on Planet Eamon, and the citizens must always be adaptable, for things are rarely what they seem and quite often not the same as they were from one day to the next!
        </p>
        <p>
            Eamon CS is played through characters who are imagined to be citizens of this weird world that belong to the famous Free Adventurer's Guild. Free Adventurers are men and women who have dared to seek their fortune in the marvelous world of
            shifting laws and time. Players will often find their characters fighting terrible monsters such as orcs, trolls, and dragons and claiming various riches and treasures as their own. However, Planet Eamon is bound by no laws of time or
            space, and anything can happen once an adventure has been started. At any random time, a character could end up facing such varied opponents as Billy the Kid or Darth Vader!

        <p>
            There are two places your character will be encountering other denizens of Planet Eamon, out on adventures and at the Main Hall of the Guild of Free Adventurers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Guild heavily protects the Main Hall and its surrounding areas. While your characters may communicate with the various people there to do business, they will not be permitted to start fights or break any other rules. The Guild also enforces
            fair business policies on the various merchants; while they will not do any real favors for your characters (except possibly giving them better prices depending upon their Charisma), they will not cheat their customers or otherwise harm them.
            They are mostly simple businessmen and women, out to relieve Free Adventurers of their gold while helping outfit them to go get more.
        </p>
        <p>
            During your adventures outside of the Main Hall, however, anything can happen. By default, any being found in an adventure may seem rather simple-minded; when they first meet your character, they will decide if they like them, dislike them, or
            choose to ignore them completely. If they are friendly, they will follow your character and fight on their side during any battles. If they are hostile, they will most likely try to fight them in deadly combat. Once they make up their minds, they
            will usually keep with their decisions, unless your character does something particularly nasty (such as ATTACK a friend) or nice (such as GIVE a "neutral" monster extremely valuable items or large sums of money).
        </p>
        <p>
            Just because monsters do or do not like your character does not always mean that they will fight to the bitter end either; some will be less courageous (or smarter) than others and will run from what they view as a losing battle. In some adventures,
            they will run out of exits and into a nearby room to which you can follow them. In others, they may leave the game altogether, never to return.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Eamon adventures are unique, however. Some will allow your character to interact further with its inhabitants, including options to make small talk, ask important questions, have conversations, give orders, get ideas, play games, etc...

        <h4>10. CREDITS AND LICENSE INFO</h4>
        <p>
            The Eamon CS Player's Manual is based on both Donald Brown's original Eamon text and especially Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe, which sets the gold standard.  While I do try to rework the text to make it unique, it can be
            challenging to do so, given the level of polish in the EDX Player's Manual.  So I'll give credit to the excellent writing of Frank Black, Luke Hewitt, and TMF.
